ASSIGNMENT:
Implement a Spymaster.

Every turn, your Spymaster will be given a dictionary of the format:

{'our words': [w1, w2, ...], 'their words': [w1, w2, ...], 'neutral words': [w1, w2, ...], 'assassin word': w1}

Your Spymaster should return a single word and corresponding number, according to the rules of the game.

Along with your program, your group should submit a 2 page written description of your overall strategy, implementation details, and a discussion of what worked well and what didn't.
